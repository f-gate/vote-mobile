## vote-mobile - Polkadot Global Series Europe
This is a way of bringing voting to the masses, many people have their wallets stored on their phone and in the future many more will. We are trying to make vote more accessible by bringing voting capabilities to mobile.

Using the wallet we aim to read the tokens avaliable and list the supported chains for voting. 
We will start by incorporating Zeitgeist's democracy process.
